<h1 style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">Welcome</h1>

I am a Research Engineer at the Laboratoire Signal, Protocoles et Plateformes Radio (LSP2R) at [CEA-Leti, Grenoble, France](https://www.leti-cea.fr/cea-tech/leti/Pages/Accueil.aspx), where I work on designing network-sharing and resource allocation mechanisms for next-generation (6G) communication systems, with a strong focus on energy efficiency and sustainability.  

I received my **PhD** in **Computer Science** from the [Centre Inria d’Université Côte d’Azur](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee) and the [Avignon Université](http://univ-avignon.fr/universite/), France, where I conducted my doctoral research entitled *“Resource allocation and pricing in 5G network slicing”* under the supervision of [Dr. Eitan Altman](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Eitan.Altman/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a **Master’s degree (M.Tech.)** in **Control Systems** from [Mumbai University](http://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I worked on motion planning for mobile robots under constraints under the guidance of [Prof. N. M. Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MVFKy-4AAAAJ&hl=en), and I completed my **Bachelor’s degree (BE)** in **Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering** from [ Amravati University](https://www.sgbau.ac.in/), India. 

Following my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Orange Innovation](https://www.orange.com/en), developing adaptive moving-target defense mechanisms for cybersecurity using reinforcement learning and partially observable stochastic games.
