<!-- Large, centered Welcome heading -->
<h1 style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">Welcome</h1>

I am a Research Engineer at the Laboratoire Signal, Protocoles et Plateformes Radio (LSP2R) at [CEA-Leti, Grenoble, France](https://www.leti-cea.fr/cea-tech/leti/Pages/Accueil.aspx), where I work on designing network-sharing and resource allocation mechanisms for next-generation (6G) communication systems, with a strong focus on energy efficiency and sustainability.  

I received my **PhD** in **Computer Science** from the [Centre Inria d’Université Côte d’Azur](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee) and the [Avignon Université](http://univ-avignon.fr/universite/), France, where I conducted my doctoral research entitled *“Resource allocation and pricing in 5G network slicing”* under the supervision of [Dr. Eitan Altman](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Eitan.Altman/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a **Master’s degree (M.Tech.)** in **Control Systems** from [Mumbai University](http://www.vjti.ac.in/), and I completed my **Bachelor’s degree (BE)** in **Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering** from [ Amravati University](https://www.sgbau.ac.in/), India. Following my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Orange Innovation](https://www.orange.com/en), where I focus on developing adaptive moving-target defense mechanisms for cybersecurity using reinforcement learning and partially observable stochastic games.  

My research over the past several years has centered on game theory, optimization, Markov decision processes, and learning in games, with their practical applications across different domains, such as Social behavior, Communication networks (5G-6G), network economics, Power networks, Blockchain and Cybersecurity.
