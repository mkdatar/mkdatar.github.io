> *“A problem well stated is a problem half solved.”*  
> — Charles F. Kettering

Although originally expressed in the context of engineering and scientific inquiry, this insight applies far more broadly. Philosophers have long recognized that meaningful progress begins with the question itself. We need to dwell on it—look at it from different angles, and think it over patiently. Often, a *well-stated question already hints at its own answer*.

This brings us to a simple but fundamental question: *What really drives our actions and choices in life?*

Here’s a little exercise you can try. Pick something you want to achieve, and ask yourself *“why”* repeatedly. For instance, studying:

- *Why do I study?* To get a job.  
- *Why do I want a job?* To earn money.  
- *Why do I want to earn money?* To live comfortably.  

Or a career choice:

- *Why do I want to be a researcher?* Because it’s fulfilling or prestigious.  
- *Why is that important?*  

Keep asking *“why”*, and eventually, the chain of reasons runs out. That’s when a *simple but profound truth emerges*: at its core, nearly every human action is motivated by the pursuit of *well-being*. In other words, *happiness is at the heart of what we do*.

You might think, *“But people often endure suffering, or even sacrifice their lives—how does that fit?”* Look closer, and you’ll see that such actions are never for suffering itself. People act this way because of *what the suffering represents or promises*.

- Someone might endure hardship in the hope of future fulfillment.  
- Fight or die for their country or faith.  
- Take drastic steps to escape unbearable pain.  

In all these cases, the choice is guided—sometimes consciously, sometimes not—by the belief that it will lead to some form of *well-being*.

Seen this way, life can be thought of as a kind of problem: we make choices to *maximize our sense of well-being over time*. From this perspective, the *most successful person* isn’t necessarily the richest, most famous, or most talented—but the one who lived *most happily*.

Why? Because *true success is achieving what you really want*, and at the deepest level, everything we do is driven by *one goal: the pursuit of happiness*. If you lived happily, then, in the truest sense, you’ve already *succeeded*.
