“A problem well stated is a problem half solved.”
— Charles F. Kettering. Although originally expressed in the context of engineering and scientific inquiry, this insight applies far more broadly.

In this context, one may ask a seemingly simple yet fundamental question: why do we do anything at all? What ultimately drives our actions and endeavors in life? Consider the example of a researcher. One may wish to publish a research paper — but why? Perhaps to gain recognition. Why recognition? To secure funding or financial stability. Why money? To access comfort, security, or opportunities. If we continue to ask “why” at each stage, the chain of reasons gradually exhausts itself, until no further justification can be given. At this point, we arrive at a simple but profound realization: at its core, every human action is motivated by the pursuit of well-being — in simple terms, because it feels good. In this sense, happiness, or the experience of satisfaction and meaning, emerges as the fundamental driver underlying all human behavior.
