“A problem well stated is a problem half solved.”
— Charles F. Kettering. Although originally expressed in the context of engineering and scientific inquiry, this insight applies far more broadly.

In this context, one may ask a seemingly simple yet fundamental question: why do we do anything at all? What ultimately drives our actions and endeavors in life? Consider the example of a researcher. One may wish to publish a research paper — but why? Perhaps to gain recognition. Why recognition? To secure funding or financial stability. Why money? To access comfort, security, or opportunities. If we continue to ask “why” at each stage, the chain of reasons gradually exhausts itself, until no further justification can be given. At this point, we arrive at a simple but profound realization: at its core, every human action is motivated by the pursuit of well-being — in simple terms, because it feels good. In this sense, happiness, or the experience of satisfaction and meaning, emerges as the fundamental driver underlying all human behavior.

One may object that human beings often accept suffering or even sacrifice their lives, seemingly contradicting the claim that happiness underlies all actions. However, a closer examination reveals that such actions are not pursued for suffering itself, but for what the suffering represents or promises. An individual may be willing to die for their country, endure hardship in the hope of salvation, or accept present pain in anticipation of greater fulfillment in the future. In each case, the action is guided by a projected state of meaning, moral satisfaction, or ultimate well-being. Beneath the action lies the belief — explicit or implicit — that the outcome is good, justified, or fulfilling, and that this alignment will bring inner satisfaction. Put differently, no human endeavor is undertaken with the sole aim of seeking unhappiness or suffering as an end in itself; suffering is endured only insofar as it is perceived as a necessary path toward a higher or future form of happiness.
